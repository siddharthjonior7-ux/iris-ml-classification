(https://colab.research.google.com/github/siddharthjunior7-ux/iris-ml-classification/blob/main/quick%20training%20on%20iris.ipynb)

This project demonstrates a simple Machine Learning model trained on the famous **Iris dataset** to classify iris flowers into different species.

The model predicts the flower species based on the following features:

- Sepal Length  
- Sepal Width  
- Petal Length  
- Petal Width  

---

## 📊 Dataset Information

The Iris dataset contains **150 samples** divided into three classes:

- Iris Setosa  
- Iris Versicolor  
- Iris Virginica  

The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Algorithm

This project uses:
RandomForestClassifier

The model is trained on the training dataset and evaluated on the test dataset.
